## Evidence of the Work that You Completed for this Assignment

Please provide the evidence of the work that you completed as part of this
week's laboratory assignment. This may involve you furnishing links to specific
GitHub issues, pull requests, or commits that highlight the contributions that
you are making to the software project. Please also note that:

* Copying over the `conduct.md` file is the way in which you show that you
  adhered to the code of conduct during this week of the project.

* After copying over the `assessment.md` file either from either the previous
  week's repository or from the main repository, you should evaluate yourself
  according to all relevant criteria. The instructor will assume that your
  evaluation level is "N" if you have not yet completed work for a category.
  Once you assess yourself for a specific professional or technical skill, you
  should furnish evidence that supports your current assessment. As you continue
  to work on the software project, you can adjust your assessment and add more
  evidence. Please see the course instructor with assessment questions.
